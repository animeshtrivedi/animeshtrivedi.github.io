## Multiple activities at ICT.OPEN 2022

ICT.OPEN 2022 ([https://www.ictopen.nl/](https://www.ictopen.nl/)) is one of the biggest IT conferences in the Netherlands where many academic institutions, research facilities, and industrial companies come together to collaborate and share their vision of Dutch research landscape. It is supported by the Dutch Research Council (NWO, [https://www.nwo.nl/en](https://www.nwo.nl/en)) and IPN (the Dutch ICT research platform, [https://ict-research.nl/](https://ict-research.nl/)). This year it is going to be held in Amsterdam. 

With a concentrated effort [1] led by Alexandru Iosup [https://atlarge-research.com/aiosup/](https://atlarge-research.com/aiosup/), this year there is a new track: **Future Computer and Network Systems (CompSys)**. My research group is presenting 

  * **[Talk]** OpenCSD: Unified Architecture for eBPF-powered Computational Storage Devices (CSD) with Filesystem Support with Corne Lukken 
  * **[Poster]** The SPEC-RG Reference Architecture for the Edge Continuum with Matthijs Jansen 
  * **[Poster]** Bento File System and the Art of Repeated Research, with Peter-Jan Gootzen
  * **[Poster]** Autoscaling for Cache Enabled Data Analytics with Sacheendra Talluri
  * **[Demo]** GradeML: Collecting and Querying of Performance Data on Machine Learning Workflows with Tim Hegeman

Congrats everyone. More details to follow as we prepare material to share.
