## Gave a talk on the VU Master's day on the VU-UvA joint Computer Science Masters program

On Saturday March 11th, 2023 VU hosted the Master's day [https://vu.nl/en/events/2023/master-s-event](https://vu.nl/en/events/2023/master-s-event) where i presented about the joint Computer Science masters (VU-UvA) to visitors. 


It was a fun event and the crowd was very enthusiastic. They asked questions about specific curriculum details, flexibility, internship opportunities as well as some interesting research questions regarding where the field of computer science research is going. 


My slides of the talk are available [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sJX1ObLwuulfgSiH3UOmzdcfIxT1rPwOw3wNBdpRPkc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sJX1ObLwuulfgSiH3UOmzdcfIxT1rPwOw3wNBdpRPkc/edit?usp=sharing).


See you at the next event!
