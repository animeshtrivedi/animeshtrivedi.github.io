Since July 2024, I am a Senior Research Scientist at IBM Research Lab, Zurich in the [Hybrid Cloud Research Group](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/cci/). 
Prior to joining the research lab, I was a tenured Assistant Professor (tenure-tracked) in the [Computer Systems (CompSys) Section](https://www.vucompsys.net/) in 
the [Department of Computer Science, VU, Amsterdam](https://www.cs.vu.nl/en/index.aspx). I led the [StoNet (Storage-Networking) research group](https://stonet-research.github.io/), which was a part of 
the [Massiving Computer Systems group](https://atlarge-research.com/) lead by [Prof. Alexandru Iosup](https://atlarge-research.com/aiosup/). 

I am a systems researcher. I like to design, implement, evaluate systems. My main research areas are in storage, networking, operating systems, and distributed systems. 
Broadly speaking, I am interested in the performance aspect of systems, spanning from multi-core CPUs to distributed systems. 
Currently, I am investigating how to leverage fast NVMe storage in data-heavy workloads like AI/ML and analytics
