### Who am I?

I am a Senior Research Scientist at IBM Research Lab, Zurich in the Hybrid Cloud Research Group. Prior to joining the research lab, I was a tenured Assistant Professor (tenure-tracked) in the Computer Systems (CompSys) Section in the Department of Computer Science, VU, Amsterdam. I have obtained my PhD and MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

### What am I interested in?

My research interests lie in building fast and efficient systems using modern hardware. I am currently focusing on two emerging research directions. First, how to leverage cheap and fast Flash and Optane NVM storage devices to support demands of data-heavy machine learning workloads. Second, how to design and build foundational software infrastructure and services for the next generation of edge computing applications.
