VU computer science students are required to perform a literature study course (X_405111) in an area of their choosing. This work is an important exercise in building a skill set for understanding an area of research by searching papers, summarizing them, connecting dots between different papers, building an overarching narrative, and writing scientific documents. However, due to the open nature of the work, it could be hard to navigate how to start the work. I often find giving the same advice to multiple students. Here is my attempt to summarize these points. 

  * It is advised to pick up an area of work which will closely match with your thesis work. It can not be the exact topic, but something more encompassing and broad. For example, if you plan to do a thesis on implementing a new file system, then the survey can be about recent advancements in the storage technologies.

  * In our initial meetings I will give a couple of seed papers and a potential list of conferences that you should search through. 

  * Come up with a paragraph of motivation for the survey. Why does this survey make sense now? What kind of “transferable” knowledge this survey will generate? What is the research question that you are attempting to answer? 

  * I am often asked how many papers or pages are enough. There is no definite answer to this question. I hope that you are not doing a survey with me just to fill up pages. The scope of the survey depends on the research activities on the field. For a well established area, you might be 100s of papers whereas for a relatively new field of search there might only be only 10 papers. 

  * Next question is how detailed the summaries should be. The nature of your summaries depends how you are writing or presenting your survey. You need to extract the supporting details from a paper to support your survey motivation and research question. 

  * A good survey will summarize the state of the art in a field in a presentable and consumable manner while working towards answering the research question. For this, I would strongly recommend thinking about what kind of visual aids (tables, figures, graphs) can you use to enhance the presentation of your survey. 

  * A good survey also identifies potential research directions or research opportunities in an area, which will open a smooth transition to your actual thesis work. Do not just write isolated summaries of a paper. 

  * As a work plan I wrongly recommend to start early. You can take the following work plan to make progress 
    * Read the seed papers, mark their related work and citations. 
    * Start backward (from their related work) and forward (from the citations of the seed papers) searches to identify further key papers. You can use Google Scholar for this.
    * Quickly read the introduction and related work section of new papers that you find in your research to get an overall idea of their work.
    * Try to build a structure of the survey - what heading, what subsection heading, what group of papers attempt to solve a similar theme of problem. This step may not be obvious, hence may require a couple of attempts. It is a continuous process and the more papers you will read, hopefully more clear the structure of the survey gets. In my experience, at some point you will stop making new subsections and “most” of the existing work will fall into the subsections that you have made. 
    * Come up with a skeleton survey draft and what papers will go where - we will have a discussion at this point. You should present your ideas and vision of the survey. 
    * After this, you can start reading the papers more carefully and synthesize pertinent details for your survey and start filling out the skeleton draft. Perhaps, in this process you have to make another adjustment to your survey. 

  * A good survey should be comprehensive. This statement does not mean that you must include all the papers published under the sun since the Genesis in your work. In my opinion, it is very important for you to identify broad “classes” of work in the area of your survey. A missing paper can be added later, but a missing “class of work” that might have altered your survey structure or theme or conclusions is not good. There is a fine balance between breadth and depth in a survey. 

  * The literature study is supposed to cover a relatively broad area of work. Hence, start early and make a rough timeline plan. Good survey takes time. There are no shortcuts. 

  * A good survey involves lots of creative work. The same set of papers can be presented in multiple ways. Hence, take this opportunity to make your own unique survey. 

  * For completeness you should also include (1) your methodology and tools used; (2) any other similar of related surveys that are available; (3) limitations of your work; (4) Outlook section in the end where you should summarize your impressions of the field, and how do you see the overall picture going forward. 

  * For practical work: I recommend to use the USENIX latex template for the survey (available here: [https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates)) and keep a progress log that you should share with me. 

Lastly, here are the evaluation criteria for your survey: 
  * Quality of study design
  * Rationale for literature selection
  * Quality of results : scientific quality of the analysis, discussion of the findings
  * Quality of writing : style, clarity, organization
  * Correctness and completeness of references and citations
  * Final presentation : final presentation (narrative style, balance between focus and coverage of contents, answering questions)
  * Independence in the work 

Computer Science is a fast moving field. Hence, good surveys are the closest reading material we have for the textbooks. A good survey from you will be publishable and perhaps will be used in courses. 

Good luck with the work!
