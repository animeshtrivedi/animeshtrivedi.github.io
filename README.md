### Who am I?
I am Animesh Trivedi, a Research Staff Member (RSM) in Cloud and Computing Infrastructure group at the IBM Research Lab, Zurich Switzerland. Earlier in 2016, I finished my PhD in Computer Science at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Thomas Gross.

### What am I interested in?

My main research areas are networking, operating systems, and distributed systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the performance aspect of systems, spanning from multi-core CPUs to distributed environments. In the past, I have designed, developed, and evaluated systems around high-performance RDMA networks and NVM storage. Currently, I am investigating how modern high-performance devices (think 40-100 Gbps network, NVMe flash, etc.) can be leveraged in large-scale data processing systems such as Spark or Hadoop.
