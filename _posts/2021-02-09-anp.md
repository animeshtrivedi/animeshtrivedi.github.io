In Sep-Oct 2020, together with [Lin Wang](https://linwang.info/), I designed and gave a new course called [Advanced Network Programming](https://studiegids.vu.nl/en/2020-2021/courses/XB_0048) for BSc. final year students at VU Amsterdam. The goal of the course is to (i) make students aware of the internals of end-host and data center networking advancements; (ii) show practical tools to debug and analyze the Linux stack; (iii) teach low-level nitty and gritty details by implementing network protocols. 


**Course project:** In the course project students implement ARP, ICMP and TCP protocols in userspace using a Linux TUN/TAP device. The framework given overloads client-side socket calls (with $LD_PRELOAD) and does basic Ethernet frame processing. Students implement socket(), connect(), send(), recv(), and close() calls (including TCP/IP packet headers, MTU payload packing, TCP state machine processing, ACK generation and processing) and show that their client-side code can successfully communicate with an unmodified Linux/server for a data exchange. 


In 2020, the course lectures cover (we plan to revise and keep the content up-to-date every year):

  **1. Introduction:** Evolution of socket, DMA, Interrupt storms, SGE capabilities. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/anp/2020-anp-lecture1-introduction.pdf)

  **3. Linux Internals:** NAPI, SoftIRQs, SKB, rx/tx paths, zcopy stacks . [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/anp/2020-anp-lecture3-linux-internals.pdf)
