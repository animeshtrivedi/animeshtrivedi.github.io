In Autumn 2020, I designed and gave a new course at VU Amsterdam for masters students - Storage Systems. The goal of the course is to teach students about the rise of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) storage technologies in commodity computing, their impact on system design (architecture, operating system), distributed systems, storage services, and application designs.

**Course project:** The course has a project in which students design and implement an FTL with GC, and a KV store on top of their FTL for an Open-Channel SSD. We used [LightNVM infrastrucutre](http://lightnvm.io/liblightnvm/index.html) inside QEMU to emulate an OCSSD. 

The course lectures cover: 

  **1. Introduction:** History, NAND flash, operations, internal organization. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture1-introduction.pdf)

  **2. Host Interfacing and Software Implications:** NVMe, storage and block-layer optimizations. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture2-host-interfacing.pdf) 

  **3. Flash FTL and Garbage Collection:** FTL and GC designs, concerns, and host-managed FTLs. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture3-ftl-gc.pdf)

  **4. Flash Filesystems:** Log-structured file systems, F2FS, DFS, and Nameless writes. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture4-fs.pdf)

  **5. Flash Key-Value Stores:** B+ Trees, Hash Tables, and LSM trees on flash. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture5-kv.pdf)

  **6. Byte-addressable Persistent Memories:** Optane, NVHeap, and Pmem/PMDK project. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture6-pmem.pdf)

  **7. Networked Flash:** Disaggregated storage, NVMoF, and FlashNet. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture7-networked-flash.pdf)

  **8. Programmable Storage:** What is it, why, and recent works in the area. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture8-programmable-storage.pdf)

  **9. Distributed Storage - I:** Distributed temporay data stroage and formats (Crail and Albis). [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture9-distributed-storage-1.pdf)

  **10. Distributed Storage - II:** Talks about Corfu and Tango distributed transaction systems. [PDF](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/stosys/2020-stosys-lecture10-distributed-storage-2.pdf)
