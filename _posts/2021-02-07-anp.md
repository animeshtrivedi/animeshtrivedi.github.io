In Sep-Oct 2020, I designed and gave a new course called Advanced Network Programming with [Lin Wang](https://linwang.info/) at VU Amsterdam for bachelors final year students. The goal of the course is to (i) make students aware of the internals of the networking stack; (ii) show practical tools to debug and analyze the Linux stack; (iii) teach low-level nitty and gritty details of network programming by implementing the ARP, ICMP, and TCP protocols (socket, connect, send, recv, close calls) in the userspace using the Linux TAP device infrastructure.

The course lectures covers:

  **1. Introduction:** Evolution of socket, DMA, Interrupt storms, SGE capabilities. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/anp/2020-anp-lecture1-introduction.pdf)

  **2. Networking Concepts:** MTU, Segmentation, stateful and stateless Offloading. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/anp/2020-anp-lecture2-concepts.pdf) 

  **3. Linux Internals:** NAPI, SoftIRQs, SKB, rx/tx paths, zcopy stacks . [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/anp/2020-anp-lecture3-linux-internals.pdf)

  **4. Multicore Networking:** Interrupt balancing, multi-queue NICs, RSS, RPS, XFS, MegaPipe. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/anp/2020-anp-lecture4-multicore.pdf)

  **5. Userspace Stacks:** Packet processing, Netmap, DPDK, mTCP. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/anp/2020-anp-lecture5-uspace-networking.pdf)

  **6. RDMA Networking:** RDMA networking, low-latency networking, history. [[PDF]](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/raw/master/files/2020/anp/2020-anp-lecture6-rdma.pdf)
