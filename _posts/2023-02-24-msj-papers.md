## Three new papers on edge computing from the group

With the joint efforts from [Matthijs Jansen](https://atlarge-research.com/mjansen/) and [Jesse Donkerviet](https://atlarge-research.com/jdonkervliet/) (PhD students), we have three new research papers covering a wide range of topics in the edge-cloud computing contiunuum:

  * **The SPEC-RG Reference Architecture for the Compute Continuum**, Matthijs Jansen, Auday Al-Dulaimy, Allesandro Vittorio Papadopoulos, Animesh Trivedi, Alexandru Iosup, The 23rd IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud, and Internet Computing, [CCGRID](https://ccgrid2023.iisc.ac.in/), 2023.

Matthijs analyzes many prevalent edge computing architecture, synthesizes common concerns, and unify them in a single Reference Architecture. It is joint work with researchers in Sweden. 

  * **Continuum: Automate Infrastructure Deployment and Benchmarking in the Compute Continuum**, Matthijs Jansen, Linus Wagner, Animesh Trivedi, Alexandru Iosup, The First FastContinuum Workshop, [ICPE FastContinuum](https://sites.google.com/view/fastcontinuum-2023/home), 2023.

In this work, we present the Continuum framework, [https://github.com/atlarge-research/continuum](https://github.com/atlarge-research/continuum), a single framework in which you can deploy a mix of bare-metal, cloud, containers (Kubernetes, KubeEdge), serverless (OpenWhisk) and VMs (with firecracker) on your premise or in the cloud. You can also emulate various network, storage, and CPU settings.

  *  **Can My WiFi Handle the Metaverse? A Performance Evaluation Of Metaâ€™s Flagship Virtual Reality Hardware**, Jesse Donkervliet, Matthijs Jansen, Animesh Trivedi, Alexandru Iosup, 6th Workshop on Hot Topics in Cloud Computing Performance, [ICPE HotCloudPerf](https://hotcloudperf.spec.org/), 2023.

In this work, Jesse and Matthijs explore the systems characteristics (CPU, network, memory) of Meta's flagship AR/VR headset - what does it take to deliver the best performance with this. There are surprises. 

The PDFs of these papers to become available soon. Stay tuned!
