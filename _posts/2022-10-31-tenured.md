## I am tenured! 

In Oct 2022, I got tenured in the department of Computer Science at VU Amsterdam. I am excited and happy to build a solid foundation at VU Amsterdam, and continue to assemble a team of students and collaborators to work on the next generation of systems projects. 

Thanks everyone!
