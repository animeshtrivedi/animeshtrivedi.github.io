I am awarded the [NWO Open Competition (XS) grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2020/04/sixteen-groundbreaking-research-projects-launched-through-third-round-nwo-open-competition---xs.html) for â‚¬ 50,000 to explore the research direction for building a CPU-free computing architecture. Here is the public summary:

<p class="a"><b>Title:</b> Project Zero: Imagining a Brave CPU-free World!<br/></p>

<p class="a"><b>Public Summary:</b> Since the beginning of computing, we have relied on the CPU for data processing. As the CPU performance improved over the decades, so did our data processing capabilities. However, we are hitting a plateau where not only the performance gains are stalling, but the CPU is now considered a major source of inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities. Project Zero proposes to completely eliminate the CPU (0% usage) and associated inefficiencies from computing. The project will revolutionize the way computation is done by building a first-of-its-kind CPU-free data-processing application that leverages modern domain-specific, programmable non-CPU devices and accelerators available today.<br/></p>

The project is expected to start in the second half of 2020.
