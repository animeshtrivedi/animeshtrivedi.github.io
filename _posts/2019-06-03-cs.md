I attended the [CompSys 2019](https://www.compsys.science/) conference. It is a local Dutch computer systems research conference where students and researchers showcase their current research topics that they are working on. For a new faculty member like me, it also gave me a good chance to introduce me, and talk to everyone. I presented the Albis work from the USENIX ATC 2018 in the conference. For my presentation I was awarded the best presentation award at CompSys 2019.
