## Gave a talk on Storage Systems at the STROM student association

Upon request from the [STORM](https://www.storm.vu/) (the study association of the departments Mathematics and Computer Science from the Faculty of Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), I gave a guest lecture on advancements in Storage Systems to a diverse set of CS, Maths, and AI students on Friday 24th June, 2022. The purpose of such a talk is to make sure students are aware of fun and exciting things that they can (i) do in storage systems; and (ii) ask storage systems to do for them, while try to convince them that it is not just about writing code. 


The title of the talk was: **What is up with Storage Systems and Why Should You Care?** 

Slides are available here: <span><a href="/files/2022/2022-storm-guest-lecture-why-storage-and-why-should-you-care.pdf"><img style="float: middle; width: 5%;" src="/images/pdf.svg" alt="" /></a></span>
