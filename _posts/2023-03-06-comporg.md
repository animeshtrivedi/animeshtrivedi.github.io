## Gave a lecture on the I/O subsystem to Bsc 1st year students in Computer Organization class

I gave a guest lecture in the computer organization class (XB_40009) to BSc 1st year students at the VU Amsterdam. 

The lecture covered: 
- the concept of an I/O bus 
- port-mapped I/O and memory-mapped I/O 
- DMA 
- Some hands-on Linux commands to explore the I/O subsystem
