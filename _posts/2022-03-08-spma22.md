## Hyperion: A Unified, Zero-CPU Data-Processing Unit (DPU)

Our 2-page position paper about building a CPU-free data processing unit (DPU) called Hyperion is accepted at Systems for Post-Moore Architectures (SPMA'22), [https://sites.google.com/view/spma22eurosys/home](https://sites.google.com/view/spma22eurosys/home) (co-located with [EuroSys'22](https://2022.eurosys.org/)). 


This is work-in-progress in a close collaboration with [Marco Spaziani Brunella](https://marcospazianibrunella.github.io/) (University of Rome Tor Vergata, Axbryd) and [Marco Bonola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-bonola-863697154) (Axbryd). We are having tons of fun  while discussing and building the Hyperion prototype which forces us to re-think the computing architecture without the CPU (consequently many headaches also ensue!) such as why FPGA, how to program such a DPU, what should be the application-interface, how to deploy in the cloud, how to design and build distributed applications? 


**Abstract:** Since the inception of computing, we have been reliant on CPU-powered architectures. However, today this reliance is challenged by manufacturing limitations (CMOS scaling), performance expectations (stalled clocks, Turing tax), and security concerns (microarchitectural attacks). To re-imagine our computing architecture, in this work we take a more radical but pragmatic approach and propose to integrate three primary pillars of computing, i.e., networking, storage, and computing, into a single CPU-free Data Processing Unit (DPU) called Hyperion. We present our vision to make the Hyperion DPU self-sufficient and self-hosting, hence not needing to attach it to any host server, thus making it a genuinely CPU-free DPU. We present our initial work-in-progress details and open challenges.


More details to follow. Stay tuned.
