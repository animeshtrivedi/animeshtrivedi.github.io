### PhD opening in storage systems research
I have a PhD opening in the area of storage systems research to design and explore application-specific storage solutions using non-volatile memory storage devices (NVMe, OpenChannel, and Zoned Namespace). 

If you have solid systems building expertise, expertise with the storage stack, kernel hacking, file systems, databases, key-value stores (any combination of such systems would do), interest in learning and building distributed systems, experience with languages C/C++/Rust/Python, then please apply here: https://workingat.vu.nl/ad/phd-position-in-application-specific-distributed-storage-systems/zsxw8o/en 

PhD at VU requires you to have a masters, hence, when apply please upload your CV and your masterâ€™s thesis (or any other most significant piece of systems work that you have done). The start date is flexible, but preferably in Autumn 2021.
