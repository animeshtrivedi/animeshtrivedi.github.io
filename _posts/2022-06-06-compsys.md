## Three talks at the 5th Dutch CompSys 2022 conference

Our research is going to present three talks at the [5th Dutch Computer Systems (CompSys) conference](https://www.compsys.science/) 2022. CompSys is our yearly computer science conference designed to showcase the success stories of Dutch Computer Systems research, while fostering and strengthening national and international collaboration.

Our talks are on: 

  1. The SPEC-RG Reference Architecture for The Edge Continuum, work lead by [Matthijs Jansen](https://atlarge-research.com/mjansen/) (PhD student) at VU Amsterdam in collaboration with Mälardalen University, Västerås, Sweden. 
  2. Understanding NVMe Zoned Namespace (ZNS) Devices, work done by [Nick Tehrany](https://nicktehrany.github.io/),MSc student from TU Delft as a part of his research project. A complete research report is available here [https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01547](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01547). 
  3. Hyperion: A Unified, Zero-CPU Data-Processing Unit (DPU), work in-progress with Marco Spaziani Brunella (University of Rome Tor Vergata, Axbryd) and Marco Bonola (CNIT/Axbryd) where we are evaluating the role of the CPU in modern computing. A full vision paper is available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08882](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08882). 
  
  See you there!
