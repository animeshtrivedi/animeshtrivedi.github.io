**Title:** Healthor: Protecting the Weak in Heterogeneous DLTs with Health-aware Flow Control

**Authors:** Jonas Theis (VU Amsterdam and IOTA Foundation), Luigi Vigneri (IOTA Foundation), Lin Wang (VU Amsterdam), and Animesh Trivedi (VU Amsterdam)

**Abstract:** Permissionless distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) utilize an underlying peer-to-peer network to disseminate transactions. These types of networks have been shown to be highly heterogeneous. However, current DLTs fail to consider this heterogeneity which can render low-end nodes to be unable to participate in consensus. In this paper we introduce Healthor, a novel heterogeneityaware flow-control mechanism that formalizes this heterogeneity in a notion of health of a node. In our early simulation results we show that Healthor enables high-end nodes to protect their weaker neighbors by buffering at their end while incurring only minimal overhead.
