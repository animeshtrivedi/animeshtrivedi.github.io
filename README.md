### Who am I?

I am an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at the Department of Computer Science, VU, Amsterdam.

Prior to joining VU, I was a Research Staff Member (RSM) in Cloud and Computing Infrastructure group at the IBM Research Lab, Zurich, Switzerland. Even before that, I obtained my PhD and MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

### What am I interested in?

My research interests lie in building fast and efficient systems using modern hardware. I am currently focusing on two emerging research directions. First, how to leverage cheap and fast Flash and Optane NVM storage devices to support demands of data-heavy machine learning workloads. Second, how to design and build foundational software infrastructure and services for the next generation of edge computing applications.
