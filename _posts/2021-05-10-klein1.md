I am awarded the [NWO Open Competition KLEIN-1 grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/sixteen-innovative-research-projects-launched-through-domain-science-klein-0) for â‚¬ 350,000 to explore the research direction for building efficient storage support for large-model ML workloads. Here is the public summary:

<p class="a"><b>Title:</b> Machine Learning from Storage: Democratizing Machine Learning for All<br/></p>

<p class="a"><b>Public Summary:</b> In machine learning, large models are associated with more accuracy and intelligence. Building and training of large models processes large amounts of data in CPU-attached and accelerator on-board DRAM memories, which are not scalable, energy-inefficient, and extremely expensive, thus putting large model training out of reach for many users. We propose to leverage Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) storage technology to design a Machine-learning-from-Storage model training paradigm, where data is dynamically moved between NVM storage and DRAM memories on-demand, thus unleashing a new class of previously-unavailable cost- and energy-efficiency for all.<br/></p>

The project is expected to start in the second half of 2021. 

<mark><b>Open PhD position:</b></mark> I am looking for a motivated PhD student to start work on this.
