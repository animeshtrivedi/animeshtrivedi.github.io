I am **Animesh Trivedi**, a Research Staff Member (RSM) in Cloud and Computing 
Infrastructure group at the IBM Research Lab, Zurich Switzerland. Earlier in 2016, 
I finished my PhD in Computer Science at ETH Zurich under the supervision 
of Prof. Thomas Gross. 
 

My main research areas are networking, operating systems, and distributed 
systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the performance aspect of 
systems, spanning from multi-core CPUs to distributed environments. 
In the past, I have designed, developed, and evaluated systems around 
high-performance RDMA networks and NVM storage. Currently, I am 
investigating how modern high-performance devices (think 40-100 Gbps
network, NVMe flash, etc.) can be leveraged in large-scale data 
processing systems such as Spark or Hadoop.
