This page contains many of the resources and advices that I share with my students when they are doing their BSc and MSc thesis work (or even short research project). This is going to be a live document where I will continue to add resources. The current version is from March, 2021. 

  * Get familiar with what is expected out of you in the thesis work. For some examples, please see the thesis examples below in Resources. In cases when it is not clear, ask me early enough. 

  * Plan your ideal thesis now. Think and plan ahead what needs to be done and when. Thesis planning, time management, and progress tracking is part of your responsibilities. Make notes of our meetings, what was discussed and what are the next steps. 

  * VU thesis template is available in the canvas page. Please set up a thesis repository, and understand what different sections you have to write. 

  * Please read my advice on the thesis content (see below in Resources). Scientific writing and presentation are very important skills and just like programming, need time and conscious effort to develop. Please pay attention to this process. 

  * Understand the grading system, and ask me. Your thesis work (i.e., coding part), the actual thesis (the writing part), and the presentation - all are graded separately. The thesis evaluation forms are also available in the Canvas page, have a look. Discuss with me your grading expectation. 

  * Use a good IDE for code development and version control tool (git preferred). If you want to learn about basic git, Lin Wang has a tutorial about it (see the link below). 

  * Attend our weekly group meetings, get to know other fellow students, discuss your topics with them, help each other out. Computer Science is a communal science. Nothing happens alone in isolation.

Lastly, take pride in your work, strive for excellence, and put out the best work you can - your name is attached to it! :)

### Important readings 

#### On scientific writing 
  * Gopen and Swan, [The Science of Scientific Writing](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/notes/blob/master/docs/the-science-of-scientific-writing.pdf) - a must read for all students before they write any report or paper.
  * Gernot Heiser, Tips and Guidance for Students Writing Papers and Reports, [https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~gernot/style-guide.html](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~gernot/style-guide.html). 

#### On conducting experiments 
  * Gernot Heiser, Systems Benchmarking Crimes, dos and don't of benchmarking, [https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~gernot/benchmarking-crimes.html](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~gernot/benchmarking-crimes.html).
  * John Ousterhout, Always Measure One Level Deeper, [https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/7/229031-always-measure-one-level-deeper/fulltext](https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/7/229031-always-measure-one-level-deeper/fulltext) - an excellent read on how to "design" and conduct experiments.
