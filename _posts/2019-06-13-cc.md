Last week I attended [the 15th Cloud Control Workshop](http://cloudresearch.org/workshops/15th/) in Sandhamn, Sweden. It was a very well organized conference with a healthy mix of academic and industry participants. The discussion topics ranged from cloud/datcenter management, edge computing, energy/carbon management, serverless computing (we organized a session), security and privacy, blockchains, systems for machine learning, scheduling, and did I mention _edge_ _computing_. It was a fairly relaxed atomsphere and everyone was eager to chat with each other. I also got to catch up with old colleagues from Switzerland. The location was pretty amazing. The island itself is not too big, and you can walk around it in couple of hours. The island has colorful houses with nice gravel alleys, shipping boats in the harbour, and sandy and deserted beaches with the population of 108! (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhamn)).
