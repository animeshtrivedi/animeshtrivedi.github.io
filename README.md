### Who am I?

I am an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at the Department of Computer Science, VU, Amsterdam.

Prior to joining VU, I was a Research Staff Member (RSM) in Cloud and Computing Infrastructure group at the IBM Research Lab, Zurich, Switzerland. Even before that, I obtained my PhD and MSc in Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

### What am I interested in?

My main research areas are networking, storage, operating systems, and distributed systems. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the performance aspect of systems, spanning from multi-core CPUs to distributed environments. Currently, I am investigating how modern, programmable, high-performance devices (100+ Gbps network, NVMe/3DXP storage, etc.) can be leveraged in large-scale data-processing systems such as Spark, Tensorflow, serverless workloads. I am one of the founding contributors of the Apache Crail (Incubating) project.
