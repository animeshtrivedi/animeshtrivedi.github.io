## Raft at PWL, Zurich 

Yesterday I presented the [Raft Consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) 
at the local [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/) 
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Papers-we-love-Zurich/events/240580418/) in Zurich. 
It was a fun evening with some interesting discussions with folks. 

Thanks all who joined! 

The slides are up [here](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/animeshtrivedi.github.io/blob/master/files/pwl-raft.pdf).
