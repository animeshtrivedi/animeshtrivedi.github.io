## Reading and writing Apache Arrow file format in Java 
In this blog post I am going to show to how to write and 
read Apache Arrow files in a stand-alone Java program.
 
 
Apache Arrow [https://arrow.apache.org/](https://arrow.apache.org/)
is a popular in-memory columnar storage format. It is to memory 
what is parquet/ORC are to disk-oriented columnar storage 
formats. The goals of the project is to standardizes in-memory 
columnar data presentation for all data processing engines (e.g., 
Spark, Drill, Impala, etc.). The standardization helps with reducing 
the communication and serialization overheads, increases shared 
code-base to manage data (e.g., parquet reading to arrow format), 
and promises to improve performance. For more details about Arrow 
please refer to the website. 


## Project setup and dependencies 
All the code I am going to discuss here is available as a maven project 
at 
[https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/ArrowExample](https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/ArrowExample) 

You can specify arrow maven dependency by putting these in the pom file. 

```xml
<dependencies>
 <dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.arrow</groupId>
  <artifactId>arrow-memory</artifactId>
  <version>0.8.0</version>
 </dependency>

 <dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.arrow</groupId>
  <artifactId>arrow-vector</artifactId>
  <version>0.8.0</version>
 </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

I highly recommend to use the `0.8` release of arrow. But if you are interested in how 
it can be done with the `0.7` release then check the `0.7-example` branch in the github 
project. 

## Apache Arrow Java writer

We first start with the pertinent writer-side objects.

**How to make schema**
We start with how to define Arrow schema on the writer side. This is done by defining 
 a `Field` object that takes a string name, type, and additional children parameter, 
 if the type is of a complex type (like list, map, etc.). We will be covering simple 
 primitive types in this blog post. A field object of type integer can be defined 
 as
  
 ```
Field intType = new Field("int", FieldType.nullable(new ArrowType.Int(32, true)), null);
 ```
