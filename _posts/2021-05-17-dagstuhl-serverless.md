### Attending the Dagstuhl Seminar on Serverless, May 17th-22nd, 2021 (online)

I am attending the Dagstuhl Seminar on Serverless Computing, [https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=21201](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=21201). Many exciting talks and discussions. Unfortunately due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the seminar is happening online. Many topics are being discussed from new deployment models, new applications, better automation and software engineering practices, plus a lot of war stories from the industry and academic participants.
